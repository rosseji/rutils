# rutils

Ross' Utility library


`pro_switch()` allows use to pass a quoted or unquoted variable name (along with a a boolean value to indicate which) which is passed to either `rlang::sym()` or `enquo()`.

If someone has a better way I'd like to know. 

Hope to update to a version that doesn't need a boolean value passed along side...
